# Ecosystem Triage

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Purpose**: Classify all papers, blog posts, and code in the oblivious-computing ecosystem as authentic vs Claude-drifted.

## Context

Claude misinterpreted "oblivious" as ORAM-style access-pattern indistinguishability and progressively replaced the author's original trapdoor computing formalism with standard crypto formalism that didn't match intent. This triage identifies what's safe to build on vs what needs recovery.

## Classification Key

- **AUTHENTIC**: Original author content, no Claude involvement. Safe to cite and build on.
- **CLAUDE-EXPANDED**: Author's ideas formalized/expanded by Claude. Core math correct; check framing.
- **MIXED**: Authentic mathematical content with Claude-era editorial/structural changes.
- **DRIFTED**: Substantially rewritten by Claude with wrong formalism. Use pre-drift commits only.

**Location**: Copied into this repo at `foundations/`.
**Originals**: `metafunctor/content/post/{bernoulli_bool,trapdoor_bool_algebra,entropy_map}/`

### C++ Library and Papers (bernoulli/)

| Item | Location | Content |

## Foundational Series in oblivious-computing/papers/

These papers were generated by Claude in Jan 2026 from the author's ideas and blog posts. No git history (non-git monorepo). All files dated Jan 24, 2026.

**Important**: The 4-paper series structure itself is a Claude artifact — the author wrote blog posts, not a 4-paper series. These are Claude's formalization of the author's ideas, not the author's papers.

### F1: Bernoulli Theory (CLAUDE-EXPANDED)

26 pages. Claude formalized the blog posts into theorem/proof structure. Core ideas are the author's:
- Latent/observed duality, confusion matrices, orders of approximation — from bernoulli-model blog post
- Composition theorem η_total = 1-(1-η_f)(1-η_g) — from noisy-gates blog post
- Hash-based construction with encoding sets — from entropy-maps blog post
- Miller-Rabin as Bernoulli map example — **author's original example** (beautiful algorithmic instance of the duality: true primality is latent, Miller-Rabin is observed)
- Floating-point vs Bernoulli distinction — **author raised this topic** (deterministic bounded error vs probabilistic error, different frameworks)
- Count-Min sketch, LSH examples, polished prose — Claude additions

**Verdict**: Useful formalization of authentic ideas. Math is correct. Not source of truth — blog posts are.

### F2: Oblivious Computing (DRIFTED)

18 pages. **This is the paper where Claude imported the wrong formalism.**
- Frames privacy as "access pattern problem" (ORAM-style)
- Defines obliviousness hierarchy: perfect/statistical/computational — standard crypto, not the author's framework
- Uses \Adv, \Simulator, \Trace, \PPT — crypto game notation
- "Random Oracle Paradox" — interesting idea but not in the author's originals
- References ORAM, differential privacy

The author's actual privacy model: cipher maps are total functions; privacy comes from one-way hash + uniform representation, not from access-pattern indistinguishability. The untrusted machine sees opaque bits through opaque tables. There is no "trace" to analyze.

**Verdict**: Drifted. Wrong formalism. The trapdoor-computing design doc replaces this.

### F3: PIR Systems (MIXED)

14 pages. Tuple encoding and frequency-proportional sizing (|Valid((x,y))| ∝ 1/Freq{x,y}) are the author's ideas. But wrapped in PIR/ORAM framing with \Server, \Client, \Adv notation. Signal/CryptDB/Tor case studies are Claude additions.

**Verdict**: Good ideas in wrong framing. Tuple encoding worth preserving.

### F4: Statistical Validation (MIXED)

12 pages. Entropy maps, binomial distributions for FP/FN counts, PPV derivation, space bounds — real and aligned with the author's work. Bloom filter benchmarks and "real-world case studies" (web crawling, genomics) are Claude filler.

**Verdict**: Math is aligned. Case studies are padding.

### Extensions

| ID | Directory | Pages | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| E1 | `extensions/regular-bernoulli-types` | 9 | CLAUDE-EXPANDED | Not deeply examined. Same Jan 2026 provenance. |
| E2 | `extensions/threshold-structures` | 11 | CLAUDE-EXPANDED | Not deeply examined. Same Jan 2026 provenance. |

## Application Papers (MIXED)

Core mathematical content is authentic. Jan-Feb 2026 commits show Claude-assisted editorial work: repository restructuring, citation management, related work updates, review cycles. The math is sound; the framing around "oblivious" may need correction to "trapdoor."

| ID | Directory | Pages | Claude-Era Changes |
|----|-----------|-------|--------------------|
| A1 | `Maximizing-Confidentiality-*` | 51 | Jan 2026: "Improve paper clarity and repository structure" |
| A3+A4 | `cipher_maps_unified` | 17 | Feb 2026: Merged from two papers, two review cycles, DESIGN doc for trapdoor reframing. Most actively Claude-edited. |
| A5 | `crypto-perf-hash` | 16 | Jan 2026: citation metadata added |
| A6 | `encrypted-search-ob-types` | 20 | Jan 2026: repo restructuring |
| A7 | `encrypted_search_confidentiality` | 17 | Jan 2026: repo restructuring |
| A9 | `known_plaintext_attack_time_series_analysis` | 24 | Jan 2026: "Add theoretical depth, pedagogical content" |
| A10 | `estimating_es_conf_moving_avg_bootstrap` | 8 | Published (IEEE CloudCom 2016). Minimal Claude-era changes. |

### Thesis (AUTHENTIC)

| ID | Directory | Pages | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------|-------|
| A8 | `encrypted_search_thesis` | 106 | Published MS thesis (2014). Jan 2026: reorganized as archive. Content authentic. |

## Separate Repositories

### boolean-algebra-over-trapdoor-sets (DRIFTED)

**Repo**: github.com/queelius/boolean-algebra-over-trapdoor-sets
**Pre-Claude boundary**: commit 549091a (2024-07-07)

| Period | Status | What Happened |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Pre-July 2024 | AUTHENTIC | Original paper development, incremental updates |
| Oct 2025 | DRIFTED | "Major release: Complete library refactor" |
| Jan 2026 | DRIFTED | "v0.5.0: Complete rewrite as minimal Python library"; paper revision "Fix technical errors, add theoretical framework" |

**Recovery**: Use commits up to 549091a only. Post-drift work imported ORAM-style formalism and departed from the trapdoor map approach.

### bernoulli/ (AUTHENTIC)

Not a git repo. Contains the original C++ bernoulli_data_type library and associated papers. Pre-Claude content throughout.

### oblivious-computing-backup/ (MIXED)

Backup copy of oblivious-computing monorepo. Contains deprecated/ and deprecated-saved/ directories suggesting awareness of drift.

## Summary

| Classification | Count | Items |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| AUTHENTIC | ~7 | 4 blog posts, C++ library, bernoulli papers, A10, A8 thesis |
| CLAUDE-EXPANDED | ~3 | F1 (good expansion), E1, E2 (not deeply examined) |
| MIXED | ~7 | F3, F4, A1, A3+A4, A5-A9 |
| DRIFTED | ~2 | F2 (wrong ORAM formalism), boolean-algebra-over-trapdoor-sets (post-July 2024) |

## Recovery Plan

1. **Blog posts are source of truth** — already preserved in `trapdoor-computing/foundations/`
2. **F2 is replaced by** the trapdoor computing design doc (`formalism/DESIGN-trapdoor-reframing.md`)
3. **F1 is useful reference** but not canonical — Claude's formalization of the author's ideas, math is correct
4. **cipher_maps_unified** rewrite on hold — formalism first, paper second
5. **boolean-algebra repo** — revert to 549091a or archive post-drift work
6. **foundational/ and extensions/ dirs** may not be worth keeping — they're Claude's interpretation of the author's work, organized in Claude's preferred structure. The blog posts + design doc are the real foundations.
