## Overview

Repository for developing the **trapdoor computing** paradigm — computing with values whose meaning is hidden behind a one-way trapdoor (cryptographic hash). Reframing of prior "oblivious computing" work with corrected formalism.

**Core thesis**: A cipher map is a total function on bit strings. Privacy comes from one-way hash + uniform representation, not access-pattern hiding.

## Stage

- **Current**: formalism development (pre-paper)
- **Origin**: Recovery from Claude-drifted "oblivious computing" papers; authentic source is 2023-2024 blog posts
- **Target venue**: Not yet selected
- **Submission deadline**: None set

## Formalism: Four Properties of a Cipher Map

Defined in `DESIGN-trapdoor-reframing.md`:

1. **Totality** — f-hat defined on all inputs. Noise has probability ε of becoming valid codeword.
2. **Representation Uniformity** — Multiple encodings per value, δ-close to uniform.
3. **Correctness** — η-bounded error for in-domain elements.
4. **Composability** — η_total = 1 - (1-η_f)(1-η_g).

## Parameter Decomposition

| Parameter | Controls | Affects |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **η** | Correctness — fraction of in-domain elements with wrong answers | Trusted machine |
| **μ** | Value encoding cost — bits per element for function values (= H(Y)) | Space |
| **ε** | Noise decode probability — probability random bits form valid codeword | Space budget |
| **|c_A S|/|S|** | Representation multiplicity — frequency equalization | Adversary observing traffic |
| **δ** | Representation uniformity — closeness to uniform distribution | Adversary with partial knowledge |

## Related Work (Ecosystem)

Full classification in `ECOSYSTEM-TRIAGE.md`. Summary:

| Classification | Items |
|----------------|-------|
| **Authentic** | 4 blog posts (foundations/), C++ bernoulli_data_type library, bernoulli/papers/, A10 (published IEEE 2016), A8 thesis |
| **Claude-expanded** | F1 (Bernoulli Theory) — good formalization of author's ideas |
| **Mixed** | F3, F4, cipher_maps_unified, application papers A1-A9 |
| **Drifted** | F2 (ORAM formalism — not author's work), boolean-algebra-over-trapdoor-sets post-549091a |

Key relationships:
- `bernoulli/` — C++ library and papers. Semi-separate; provides the error model.
- `oblivious-computing/papers/cipher_maps_unified/` — Most developed paper. On hold pending formalism.
- `boolean-algebra-over-trapdoor-sets/` — Pre-July-2024 commits authentic; later drifted.

## Next Actions

### Formalism (current priority)
- [ ] Tighten the four properties against concrete constructions from blog posts
- [ ] Connect noisy-gates composition story to cipher map composition theorem
- [ ] Formalize the trusted/untrusted machine model
- [ ] Decide what to do with drifted papers (archive, revert, or rebuild)

### Paper Development (after formalism)
- [ ] Write cipher maps paper using trapdoor computing formalism
- [ ] Rewrite Section 4 of cipher_maps_unified with formal trapdoor definition
- [ ] Update title, abstract, and introduction
- [ ] Select target venue

### Ecosystem Cleanup
- [ ] Decide fate of foundational/ and extensions/ dirs in oblivious-computing (Claude-generated)
- [ ] Revert or archive boolean-algebra-over-trapdoor-sets post-549091a
- [ ] Correct "oblivious" → "trapdoor" in salvageable papers
